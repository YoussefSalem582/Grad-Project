- **Enhanced Navigation Utilities**: 
  - `pushAndClearStack()` for complete navigation reset
  - `pushReplacement()` for replacing current screen
  - `popUntil()` for complex navigation flows
- **Arguments Support**: Proper argument passing for dynamic screens

### 4. Screen Transitions
Created `ScreenTransitions` utility with multiple transition types:
- Slide transitions (left, right, bottom)
- Fade transitions
- Scale transitions
- Rotation transitions
- Combined transitions (fade+scale, slide+fade)

### 5. Screen State Management
Implemented comprehensive state management utilities:

#### ScreenStateManager Widget
- Centralized state handling for loading, error, empty states
- Automatic screen switching based on state
- Customizable messages and actions

#### ScreenStateMixin
- Mixin for StatefulWidgets to easily manage screen states
- Methods: `setLoading()`, `setLoaded()`, `setError()`, `setEmpty()`
- Built-in state persistence and UI updates

#### ScreenActions Utility
- Common screen actions (snackbars, dialogs)
- Themed success/error/warning/info messages
- Confirmation dialogs with customizable styling

## Usage Examples

### Using Screen State Management
```dart
class MyScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  // ... widget implementation
}

class _MyScreenState extends State<MyScreen> with ScreenStateMixin {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return buildWithState(
      child: YourActualScreen(),
      onRetry: _retry,
      onRefresh: _refresh,
    );
  }
  
  void _loadData() {
    setLoading(message: 'Loading data...');
    // Your data loading logic
    // Call setLoaded(), setError(), or setEmpty() based on result
  }
}
```

### Using Enhanced Navigation
```dart
// Navigate with custom transition
Navigator.push(
  context,
  ScreenTransitions.slideFromRight(NextScreen()),
);

// Show loading screen
AppRouter.toLoading(context, message: 'Processing...');

// Show error screen
AppRouter.showError(context, 
  title: 'Network Error',
  message: 'Please check your connection',
  onAction: () => _retry(),
);
```

This enhanced screen structure provides a solid foundation for building a professional, user-friendly mobile application with consistent UI patterns and smooth user experience.
