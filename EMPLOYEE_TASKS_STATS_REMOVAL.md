# Employee Tasks Screen - Stats Removal Complete ✅

## 🎯 Task Completed
Successfully removed all statistical information from the Employee Tasks Screen header to maintain a clean, professional interface.

## 🗑️ Removed Elements

### Task Summary Stats
**Removed from header section**:
- "Total 12" - Total task count
- "Pending 7" - Pending task count  
- "Completed 5" - Completed task count

### Code Changes
**File**: `lib/presentation/screens/employee/employee_tasks_screen.dart`

**Removed**:
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    _buildTaskSummary('Total', '12', AppColors.primary),
    const SizedBox(width: 16),
    _buildTaskSummary('Pending', '7', AppColors.warning),
    const SizedBox(width: 16),
    _buildTaskSummary('Completed', '5', AppColors.success),
  ],
),
```

**Removed Method**:
- `_buildTaskSummary()` - No longer needed since stats were removed

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### Before:
- Header showed: "My Tasks" + subtitle + task count statistics
- Cluttered header with numbers

### After:
- Clean header with: "My Tasks" + subtitle only
- Professional, minimalist appearance
- Added spacing adjustment for better layout

## ✅ Benefits
- **Cleaner Interface**: Removed visual clutter from header
- **Consistent Design**: Matches other screens with stats removed
- **Focus on Content**: Users focus on actual tasks rather than numbers
- **Professional Look**: Clean, modern interface

## 🚀 Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Employee Tasks Screen is now stats-free and consistent with the clean app bar design!

The screen now shows only essential information (title and subtitle) in the header, making it clean and professional.
